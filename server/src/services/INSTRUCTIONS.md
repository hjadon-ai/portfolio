# Server services

This folder contains integrations and shared domain helpers used by server routes. Email delivery is local-only and sends through Mailpit on SMTP port `1025`. Finance keeps its provider interface, Plaid adapter, synchronization logic, and token encryption under `finance/`. The validated runtime selects only the allowlisted Sandbox or Production host; provider secrets never belong in browser code or committed files. Diet CSV parsing, normalization, validation, macro calculation, and quantity scaling live in `diet.js` so individual and bulk meal paths use the same rules.
