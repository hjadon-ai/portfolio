# Server services

This folder contains integrations and shared domain helpers used by server routes. Dev and Stage email uses local Mailpit on SMTP port `1025`; Production uses the authenticated SMTP settings validated by the runtime. Finance keeps its provider interface, Plaid adapter, synchronization logic, and token encryption under `finance/`. The validated runtime selects only the allowlisted Sandbox or Production host; provider secrets never belong in browser code or committed files.
